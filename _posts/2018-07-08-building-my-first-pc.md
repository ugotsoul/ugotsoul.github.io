title: 'Building my first gaming PC: Luddites Bain'
---

After trying to unsuccessfully share a gaming PC with my partner for about a year, and I have wanted to buy my own  PC. I had tried to use a Mac Mini (2014) for freelance projects for several months, but found it too be very slow when trying to spin up virtual environments. Also, I really hate sharing.  Sorry Dan.

My partner bought his PC from superbiiz - a super iffy sounding, but longtime provider of prebuilt motherboards and PC components.  He had built his own computer before, and watching him assemble the gaming PC, motivated me to want to build my own from scratch. I'd been curious about the maker community for a while, and it seemed like a natural progression of my interests.

I wanted a PC that I could play mostly indie games on, with the occasional graphic intestive game. Also, I wanted to try out machine learning at home and not pay AWS fees, which can quickly add up, especially if you forget to turn off your ec2 instances... :(

Anyway, here she is, my hefty child, luddite's bain:

I ended up with something mid-range, falling about $1000 with tax from Microcenter. I LOVE Microcenter: the rep who helped me was very nice and kept his upselling to a minimum (they really wanted me to buy the "I done fucked up building my PC at home, HELP" insurance). I've had terrible luck with dented packages from Amazon, and did not want to wait for components to arrive.
